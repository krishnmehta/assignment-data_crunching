# Problem Data Crunching
Language - Python

Approach
1) Import Pandas library
2) Using pandas library read all the tsv files
3) Extracting required columns from tsv files using dictionary
4) Since it is in dictionary we need to convert it from dictionary to dataframe using pd.DataFrame
5) After that export the Output file

Input File - Same as given in question

Output File - I was unable to upload the output file due to size limit, so I have put the screenshot of it.
